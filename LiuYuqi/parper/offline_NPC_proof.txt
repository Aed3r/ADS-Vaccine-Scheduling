[Additional conditions]
patient's first dose feasibile time interval == first dose processing time
and
patient's second dose feasibile time interval == second dose processing time

[proof]:
1.if there are "n" patients, we at most need n hospitals. So divided question into n subquestions:
	subquestion(i): if there have a scheduling plan to arrange all patients?
	for each subquestion, if there has a input, we can prove this input right or not in o(n) time.
	So the subquestion is np question.
hence, the main question can be proved in o(n^2), this is a np question.

2.we can transform "Graph Coloring Problem"(a NPC question) into this question, that each patients' dose feasibile time interval is a vertex in 
graph. And if patient_i time overlap with patient_j, there would has a edge between i and j.
hence, this question is NPC in this additional conditions.
